### What I learned
- display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; allows for centers contents inside elements
- background-linear: (btttm/color, top/colo) = applies a transitional appears to colors defined in elements
- border-collapse: collapse = in tables allows you to add and adjust padding in td
